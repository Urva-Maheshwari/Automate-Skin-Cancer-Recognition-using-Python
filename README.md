<h2><b>Industry Name: </b></h2>

<p>
<h2><b>Project Title: </b></h2>
Automate Skin Cancer Recognition using Python
</p>

<p>
<h2><b>
        Problem Statement:
    </b></h2>
Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. However,
identifying skin cancer accurately in its early stages can be difficult for medical professionals. Additionally, in many
parts of the world, there is a shortage of skilled medical professionals, and people have to travel long distances to
access medical care. To address these challenges, we propose an automated skin cancer recognition system that can
identify different types of skin cancers by just uploading a photo.
</p>

<p>
<h2><b>
        Project Description:
    </b></h2>
Our project is a skin cancer recognition software based on Python and built on Microsoft Azure. The core idea of our
project is to solve the problem of identifying different types of skin cancers by leveraging the power of machine
learning and artificial intelligence. Our software uses advanced algorithms and deep learning techniques to analyze
uploaded images of skin lesions and identify the presence of cancerous cells.

The purpose of our project is to automate the skin cancer recognition process, which can save time and effort for
medical professionals and patients alike. The basic functionality of our software includes uploading an image of a skin
lesion, analyzing it, and providing a result indicating whether skin cancer is present or not.

Our project addresses a clear need in the healthcare industry, where early detection of skin cancer is crucial for
effective treatment. Our software can help overcome the challenges of accurately diagnosing skin cancer in its early
stages by providing an instant result to anyone who uploads an image of a skin lesion. This can be especially helpful in
areas with a shortage of skilled medical professionals, where patients may have to travel long distances to access
medical care.
